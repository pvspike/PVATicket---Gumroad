# PVATicket---Gumroad PHP SCRIPT

Hello! Do you sell Gumroad products under license?

Do you want to provide technical support for your customers who have a valid license?

We created a special ticket system for this.

How does it work?

When you put a product on Gumroad you have to check "Generate a unique license key per sale"

When your customer buys your product, he will receive a unique license and with that license he will be able to register in the PVATicket system.

Without a valid license, no one can register on the PVATicket system

If you have more products, this is not a problem. Your customer will be able to open a ticket only in the category of the product purchased.

If the customer has several products purchased from you, he can open several tickets with a single account but with different licenses

For each product you can write articles for documentation or answers for frequently asked questions.

The PVATicket system is built in pure PHP + PDO MySql and the template is built with Smarty and Bootstrap

Registration / logging system - secure, the information is encrypted in the database.

You need web hosting, a domain or a subdomain to use this product

You will receive a free update.

Free ticket support
